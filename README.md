# Image-Algorithm-of-Paper
This repository is supported by Samzhang and leaded by Kunjie Chen professor, both in Engineering Institute of NJAU in China.
We devote ouself to promote agricultural development in automation and informatization that we create this repository to propose some image algorithms of papers. We will publish some algorithms which implement in python or other OOP codes. This project will contain two parts, the one is pattern recognition and the other one is artificial intelligence.
